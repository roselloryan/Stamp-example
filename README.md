# About stamps with Dinosaurs

Something about stamps and how boring they could be, but somehow aren't.

Dinosaurs are larger and more dangerous than most stamps.They frequently fall in love and destroy many trees in the process. This is how they become extinct. It also lead to the creation of oil, natural gas and furious polka music.

I forgot to mention stamps. They stick, but only if you lick them. Not many things work that way.
